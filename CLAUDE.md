# Fullstack Scaffold — Project Context

Reusable fullstack starter. Goal: clean, copy-paste-friendly patterns. Prioritize clarity and good structure.

## Project docs
| Purpose | Location |
|---|---|
| Current state | `## Current State` section below |
| API contracts + FE integration notes | `server/README.md` → `Frontend Integration Notes` |
| Server conventions + commands | `server/CLAUDE.md` |
| Client conventions + API contracts | `client/CLAUDE.md` |
| Formatter (server) | `npm run format` from `server/` |
| Formatter (client) | `npm run format` from `client/` |
| README to update on change | `server/README.md` and `client/README.md` |

## Env Vars (root `.env`)

```
POSTGRES_USER=
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
POSTGRES_DB=
```

Used by `docker-compose.yml` — both to initialize the `postgres` container and, via variable substitution, to build the `DATABASE_URL` that the `server`/`worker` containers actually connect with (their own `server/.env`'s `DATABASE_URL` points at `localhost`, which is correct for local dev but not reachable from inside a sibling container — see `docker-compose.yml`'s `server`/`worker` `environment:` overrides).

## Current State

**Full Docker setup — done.** `docker compose up --build` starts the entire stack (client, server, worker, Postgres, Redis) with no local Node/Postgres/Redis install required, using `.env.example` files that already have working local defaults — no editing needed for the core app to boot. `server/Dockerfile` is a multi-stage build shared by both the `server` and `worker` compose services (`command:` override selects the entrypoint); its `docker-entrypoint.sh` runs `prisma migrate deploy` and (outside `NODE_ENV=production`) `prisma db seed` automatically before starting — both are safe to re-run on every boot, not just the first. `client/Dockerfile` builds a static Vite bundle (`ARG VITE_API_URL=/api`, relative/same-origin since nginx now fronts the whole app) served by nginx, which reverse-proxies `/api` and `/socket.io` to the `server` service using a dynamic-DNS resolver pattern (`resolver 127.0.0.11` + a variable in `proxy_pass`) so it survives the `server` container being recreated without needing its own restart. `server`/`worker`'s `DATABASE_URL`/`REDIS_URL` default to the bundled `postgres`/`redis` containers but can be overridden by setting either in the root `.env` — points the stack at an external database/Redis instance instead, no code change needed. All compose resources (containers, images, volumes, network) share a consistent `scaffold` project name/prefix (explicit `name: scaffold` at the top of `docker-compose.yml`). CI's `.github/workflows/ci.yml` gained a `docker` job that builds all three images so a broken Dockerfile fails the build.

**FE modernization — done.** All four auth forms (Login, Register, Forgot Password, Reset Password) run on React Hook Form + Zod, with factory-function schemas for i18n error messages. The reviewer pass over the combined CI + security-hardening + full-Docker diff is complete, and `develop` merged to `main` for that batch.

**API error convention — built.** `CustomError`/`errorHandler` carry a stable `code`; no bare `message` reaches the client. See `zod.md` for the full convention (response shape, named codes, `VALIDATION_ERROR` carve-out).

**Product catalog & caching — done.** `Product` reshaped with `Category`/`Like` relations, cursor-based pagination with color/shape/price filters + sort, pg_trgm trigram search on name, and Redis-backed response caching on `GET /product` and `GET /product/:id` with cache-stampede lock protection and precise list-vs-detail invalidation. Load-tested via k6 against ~400k seeded products at 300 concurrent users (see `server/README.md`'s Performance Notes). Reviewer pass on the whole branch preceded merge to `develop` → `main`.

**Next — Stripe checkout**, per `roadmap.md`.
