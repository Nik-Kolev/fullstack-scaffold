# fullstack-scaffold

Production-ready fullstack starter. Clean architecture, copy-paste-friendly patterns, and a full feature set so you can focus on building product instead of infrastructure.

## What's Included

| **Background jobs** | BullMQ — email queue worker, nightly token cleanup cron |
| **File storage** | Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible) — multi-file upload, folder listing, delete |
| **Payments** | Stripe Checkout — one-time sessions, webhook handling, payment history |
| **Realtime** | Socket.io — per-user rooms, JWT auth on every connection |
| **Cache** | Redis — response caching, access token blacklisting on logout |

```

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 20+, Docker Desktop running.

```bash
# Server
cd server
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in your API keys — see server/README.md for where to get them
npm run dev            # starts Docker containers, then the server on :8080
npm run worker         # BullMQ worker (separate terminal) — handles email jobs, token cleanup cron
# or start both together:
npm run dev:all        # server + worker in one terminal, colour-coded output

# Client (new terminal)
cd client
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev            # starts the client on :5173
```

See [`server/README.md`](server/README.md) and [`client/README.md`](client/README.md) for full setup, env vars, and commands.

## Seed Data

After starting the server, seed the database:

```bash
cd server && npm run db:seed
```

| Email | Password | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `test@abv.bg` | `password` | `user` |
| `admin@abv.bg` | `password` | `admin` |

## Third-Party Services

The scaffold integrates several external services. All are free-tier friendly for development:

| Service | Used for | Sign-up |
|---|---|---|
| Google Cloud Console | OAuth 2.0 | [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) |
| Resend | Transactional email | [resend.com](https://resend.com) |
| Cloudflare R2 | File storage | [dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com) |
| Stripe | Payments | [dashboard.stripe.com](https://dashboard.stripe.com) |

You can leave any service's env vars blank if you're not using that feature yet — unrelated routes will still work.
